# Named-Entity-Recognition

## Overview
This project implements a deep learning-based Named Entity Recognition (NER) model utilizing Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM) architecture and the CoNLL2003 dataset. The model accurately identifies and classifies entities such as names, locations, organizations, and miscellaneous entities in the text. The solution is integrated with Streamlit, providing a seamless and interactive user interface for efficient text analysis.

## Features
- **LSTM-Based NER:** Leverages deep learning for improved entity recognition.
- **Pretrained Embeddings:** Utilizes word embeddings for better context understanding.
- **CoNLL2003 Dataset:** Trained on a widely used benchmark dataset for NER.
- **Real-Time Predictions:** Processes and classifies named entities dynamically.
- **Streamlit UI:** Provides a user-friendly interface for entering and analyzing text.
- **Scalable & Efficient:** Optimized for accuracy and performance.
